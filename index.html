  <h1>Who is Lucas Mollerstuen?</h1>
  <p>Lucas Mollerstuen (mole-er-stew-in) grew up in Salem, OR. and moved to Portland, OR. at the age of 19 to go to school and live in a larger city. Very quickly he purchased a coffee shop, The OZ Cafe, and settled into the business world. After three years he sold the cafe and moved into bartending and I.T. for the forseeable future. Over the next ten years he would bartend around Portland, as well as travel up and down East Asia and Australia as a bar trainer and volunteer with All Hands. His most recent work has been in I.T. for banks and hospitals before setting his sights on back-end programming with the encouragement of his computer engineer wife.</p>
